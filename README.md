# CascViewUnity
CascLibUnity is a Unity-compatible C# wrapper of Zezula's CascLib for reading Blizzard CASC storages.<br>
<br>
Looking for help to finish this tool!<br>
<b>Todo:</b>
- Create a Texture2D from a BLP image data (without converting to PNG).
- Create a Mesh from an M2 file (without converting to OBJ).
- Complete a "File Browser" style Editor Window for previewing CASC contents.
